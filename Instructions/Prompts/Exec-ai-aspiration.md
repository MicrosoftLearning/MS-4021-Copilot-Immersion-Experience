## AI Aspiration and Opportunity

Explore how you can define a 12-month AI aspiration, assess your
organization's readiness, and identify a high-impact opportunity to
accelerate AI value.

This exercise uses **Copilot as a strategic thinking partner** to help
you clarify priorities, identify gaps, and define concrete next actions.

You'll perform three tasks:

- Define your AI aspiration
- Assess AI readiness across key drivers
- Identify your AI gap and opportunity for action

> **NOTE:** Sample prompts are provided to help you get started---feel
> free to personalize them for your role, organization, and priorities.

## Task 1: Define Your AI Aspiration (12-month)

Start by identifying the business outcomes you want AI to influence over
the next year. Focus on **outcomes**, not tools.

### 1. Identify Business Priorities

Reflect on the top priorities critical to your role (for example,
efficiency, growth, innovation, or risk reduction). Use **Copilot Chat**
to brainstorm and refine your priorities.

- Open a new browser tab and navigate to [m365.cloud.microsoft/chat](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat).

- Ensure the **Work mode** tab is selected in **Copilot Chat**.

    **Sample Prompt:**
  
    ``` text
    From my role as [insert role], what are the top 1–2 business priorities that AI could materially impact over the next 12 months? Focus on outcomes, not technology.
    ```

    > **Capture your response** in Word, OneNote, or Copilot Pages. You will use these notes in Task 3.

### 2. Define What Success Looks Like

Describe what visible results would signal success if your AI aspiration were realized.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
If we successfully achieved this AI aspiration, what measurable outcomes or changes would indicate success? Provide examples of metrics or observable improvements.
```

> **Capture your response** for use in Task 3.

### 3. Select AI Value Areas

Review the four AI value areas and identify which would most directly
move your priorities:

## Task 2: Assess AI Readiness

Now that you’ve defined your aspiration, assess where your organization stands today.

### AI Readiness Drivers

Assess maturity across these five drivers:

1. Business Strategy
1. Technology Strategy
1. Applied AI Experience
1. Organization & Culture
1. AI Governance

  ![AI readiness maturity model with five drivers and five maturity levels.](../Prompts/Media/readiness.png)

Use Copilot to reflect on where your organization sits today across these drivers.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
Act as a strategic advisor. Based on the AI readiness model, help me assess my organization’s current maturity across business strategy, technology strategy, applied AI experience, organization & culture, and AI governance. Summarize where we are today (Exploring, Planning, Implementing, Scaling, or Realizing).
```

> **Capture your response** for use in Task 3.

## Task 3: Identify Your Gap → Opportunity

Next, compare your aspiration with your current state to identify the most important gap and opportunity.

### Step 1: Ask Copilot to Summarize Your Gap

``` text
Here is my AI aspiration and AI readiness self-assessment:
[paste notes]

Summarize in 3–5 sentences the key gap between my aspiration and current state. 

Then write an 'opportunity to accelerate AI impact' statement showing how closing this gap could unlock measurable value.
```

### Step 2: Refine Your Opportunity for Action

Identify one area where **you can lead or sponsor change** to close the gap.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
What is the single highest-impact action I could lead in the next 90 days to close this AI gap and accelerate measurable business value?
```

## Final Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

- A clear 12-month AI aspiration
- A snapshot of your organization's AI readiness
- A defined AI gap and opportunity statement
- A concrete action you could lead or sponsor
