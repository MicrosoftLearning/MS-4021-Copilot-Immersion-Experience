# Define Your AI Aspiration & 90-Day AI Plan

In this workshop, you will:

1. Define a clear 12-month AI aspiration (focused on business outcomes)
2. Identify the key gap between today and that aspiration
3. Design a focused 30/60/90-day plan to accelerate measurable impact
4. Craft a concise executive pitch

Copilot will act as a **strategic thinking partner**, not a replacement
for your judgment.

## Part 1: Define Your 12-Month AI Aspiration (8--10 minutes)

Start with outcomes - not tools.

### Step 1: Clarify Your Priority

Open **Copilot Chat (Work mode)** and refine 1-2 business priorities where AI could materially move the needle.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
For my organization (or my role as [insert role]), what are the top 1–2 business priorities that AI could materially impact over the next 12 months?

Focus on measurable business outcomes, not specific technologies.
```

Capture your refined priority.

### Step 2: Define What Success Looks Like

Now define your AI aspiration.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
If we successfully used AI to accelerate this priority over the next 12 months, what measurable outcomes would indicate success?

Help me articulate a clear AI aspiration statement in 2–3 sentences.
```

You should now have:

- A 12-month AI aspiration
- 1--2 measurable indicators of success

## Part 2: Identify the Gap

Briefly assess your current state.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
Here is my 12-month AI aspiration:
[past]

Based on this, what are the biggest capability or execution gaps that could prevent us from achieving it?

Summarize the top 1–2 gaps in 3–5 sentences.
```

Now narrow it:

``` text
Of these gaps, which one is the highest-leverage area to address in the next 90 days?
```

You now have a focused problem to solve.

## Part 3: Design Your 30/60/90-Day AI Plan

Focus on five elements:

1. Strategic intent
2. Value hypothesis
3. Success metric
4. First actions
5. Accountable owner

### Step 1: Draft Your Plan

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
Based on my AI aspiration and identified gap:

Help me design a focused {30/60/90}-day plan that delivers measurable progress.

Structure it with:
- Strategic intent (why this matters now)
- A simple value hypothesis (If we do X, then Y happens because Z)
- One measurable success metric
- 1–2 actions in the next 30 days
- Who should be accountable
- What progress should look like at 60 and 90 days

Keep it realistic and appropriately scoped for a pilot.
```

Refine for clarity and measurability.

## Part 4: Craft a 1-Minute Executive Pitch

Turn your plan into a concise narrative.

**Sample Prompt:**

``` text
Based on my 30/60/90-day AI plan, help me create a clear 1-minute executive pitch.

The pitch should explain:
- The business problem
- The AI opportunity
- The 90-day action plan
- The measurable impact
- Why this matters now

Make it concise, outcome-focused, and executive-ready.
```

## Outcome of This Workshop

By the end of this session, you will have:

- A clear 12-month AI aspiration
- A defined execution gap
- A focused 30/60/90-day action plan
- A concise executive pitch you can use immediately
